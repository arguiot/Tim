Tim is a perfect simple blog theme for people who cares about design and who wants a very simple blog. It has been designed to help readers read better with a very meticulous choice of typography. Tim is both very simple and really very pleasant to use: it is compatible with all current browsers, and fully responsive to improve the user experience.

It's also compatible with the new dark mode in iOS 13/macOS. Your users will love this feature.

## Installation

If you want to use this theme, it's easy: just fork this repository and change the `_config.yml`

We also **strongly** recommend using [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io) as your CMS as Tim was created with it.
